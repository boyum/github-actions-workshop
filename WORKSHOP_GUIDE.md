### Lesson 12: Workflow Reusability and Best Practices (75 min)

- Reusable workflows
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization
- Maintainability patterns
- **Key Concept**: Production-ready workflows that scale

## Sample Application

The workshop includes a simple Node.js task manager application:

### Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js          # Main application entry
â””â”€â”€ taskManager.js    # Task management logic

tests/
â””â”€â”€ taskManager.test.js   # Comprehensive test suite

build.js              # Build script
package.json          # Dependencies and scripts
```

### Features

- CRUD operations for tasks
- Priority levels
- Completion tracking
- Full test coverage
- Build process

### Purpose

- Realistic codebase for CI/CD exercises
- Working tests for automated testing lessons
- Build output for deployment lessons
- Students don't need to understand app logicâ€”focus stays on GitHub Actions

## Teaching Tips

### For Instructors

1. **Encourage Experimentation**: Remind students they can't break anythingâ€”it's a forked repository.

2. **Emphasize Errors as Learning**: Lesson 6 intentionally introduces bugs. Frame this as normal and valuable.

3. **Link to Real World**: Ask students to think about their own projects and how they'd apply concepts.

4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't overwhelm beginners with advanced topics. The lesson structure naturally builds complexity.

5. **Practical Over Theoretical**: Every lesson includes hands-on exercises. Ensure students complete them.

### Common Student Challenges

**Challenge**: YAML syntax errors
**Solution**: Recommend yamllint.com for validation

**Challenge**: Workflows not triggering
**Solution**: Check file location (`.github/workflows/`), YAML syntax, and trigger conditions

**Challenge**: Secrets not working in forked repos
**Solution**: Explain GitHub's security modelâ€”secrets aren't available to forked PR workflows

**Challenge**: Tests pass locally but fail in CI
**Solution**: Discuss environment differences, missing dependencies, and reproducibility

## Workshop Customization

### Adapting for Different Languages

While the workshop uses Node.js, the concepts apply to any language:

**For Python**:

- Replace `actions/setup-node` with `actions/setup-python`
- Use `pip` instead of `npm`
- Adapt test commands for pytest

**For Go**:

- Use `actions/setup-go`
- Adjust build and test commands
- Emphasize cross-platform builds with matrix

**For Containers**:

- Add Docker build steps
- Use container registries
- Introduce Docker actions

### Time-Constrained Workshops

**Half-Day Workshop (4 hours)**: Lessons 1-6

- Fundamentals only
- Gets students productive quickly
- Perfect for bootcamps

**Full-Day Workshop (8 hours)**: Lessons 1-9

- Includes testing and deployment
- Comprehensive coverage
- Suitable for corporate training

**Two-Day Workshop (16 hours)**: All 12 lessons

- Complete curriculum
- Advanced topics included
- Best for intensive training programs

## Assessment and Completion

### Student Completion Criteria

Students have successfully completed the workshop when they can:

- Create workflows from scratch
- Debug failing workflows systematically
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with testing and deployment
- Use matrix builds and caching effectively
- Create custom actions for reusability
- Apply security and performance best practices

### Suggested Capstone Project

Have students create a complete CI/CD pipeline for their own project that includes:

1. Automated testing on PR
2. Build process
3. Deployment to staging (automatic)
4. Deployment to production (manual approval)
5. At least one custom action
6. Proper secrets management
